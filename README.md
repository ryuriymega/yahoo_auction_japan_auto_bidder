# yahoo_auction_japan_auto_bidder
Some years ago ( early 2015 ) I worked on a project where users requested withdrawals from their accounts and we process it from our back-end for each request like in this video.  Yahoo Japan Auction Users send withdrawals requests and we process it via backend:  Apache2 + Mysql + PHP + GWT + JavaScript.
